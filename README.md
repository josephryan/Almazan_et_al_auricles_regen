Supplementary File S2. Analysis of differential gene expression in G. dorotocephala auricles.  Exel (.xlsx file) containing the IDs of 268,178 reference transcriptome supercontigs (1st column) as well as matching accession number, description, and E-value of top BLASTX human protein sequence matches (2nd, 3rd, and 4th column).  Fold-change enrichment between average transcripts per million (TPM) mapped from auricle reads (14th column) as compared to average TPM from body reads (13th column) is shown (5th column).  p-value calculated using Studentâ€™s t-test analysis of TPM counts from three independent sets of body (7th-9th columns) and auricle (10th-12th columns) reads is included as statistical assessment of differential gene expression (6th column).  Sum of total TPMs from all samples mapped to each contig are included (15th column).
